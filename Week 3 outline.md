# An Autobiography 

## What Makes a Good Novel? 

> “In this chapter I will venture to name a few successful novelists of my own time, with whose works I am acquainted; and will endeavour to point whence their success has come, and why they have failed when there has been failure” (Trollope 243).

* **Gaby's close reading** 
	* "Why do people read novels? Are novels read simply to “find out what will happen?” 
	* "Mr. Trollope, on the other hand, has vowed that there shall be no surprises in his novels. The characters shall be naturally evolved; the incidents shall grow out of each other; the passion shall not be exaggerated, and the sentiment shall veritably belong to the event." - E.S. Dallas' review 
	* If there is no suspense in Trollope's novels, what do they run on?

> “But let the gentle-hearted reader be under no apprehension whatsoever. It is not destined that Eleanor shall marry Mr. Slope or Bertie Stanhope. And here perhaps it may be allowed to the novelist to explain his views on a very important point in the art of telling tales. He ventures to reprobate that system which goes so far to violate all proper confidence between the author and his readers by maintaining nearly to the end of the third volume a mystery as to the fate of their favourite personage. Nay, more, and worse than this, is too frequently done. Have not often the profoundest efforts of genius been used to baffle the aspirations of the reader, to raise false hopes and false fears, and to give rise to expectations which are never to be realized? Are not promises all but made of delightful horrors, in lieu of which the writer produces nothing but most commonplace realities in his final chapter? And is there not a species of deceit in this to which the honesty of the present age should lend no countenance? And what can be the worth of that solicitude which a peep into the third volume can utterly dissipate? What the value of those literary charms which are absolutely destroyed by their enjoyment? When we have once learnt what was that picture before which was hung Mrs. Ratcliffe's solemn curtain, we feel no further interest about either the frame or the veil. They are to us merely a receptacle for old bones, an inappropriate coffin, which we would wish to have decently buried out of our sight.” (Barchester Towers)

## Serialization

* "The production of novels in serial form forces upon the author the conviction that he should not allow himself to be tedious in any single part." (An Autobiography, 143)
* How does serialization affect the pace of the narrative and the ability for the author to intervene? 
* What do we make of Trollope's killing of Mrs. Proudie when confronted by criticism of her character? (An Autobiography, 275)


What emerges is that Trollope is chiefly concerned with two criteria:

* Is the novel realistic (or “human”)?
* Is the reader’s experience pleasurable?


## Style 
* What does Trollope believe is important to the style of the novel? Does Trollope’s own style  conform to his expectations?
* How does authorial intrusion affect realism and his style? 
	 * Irony and allusion: 
	 * **Corey’s close reading**
	 	* "[Irony] emphasizes the parochial and unexceptional nature of events in Barchester through light comedy, which actually fulfills Trollope’s realist mission by divesting the plot of any serious drama exceeding the bounds of normal human experience. For Trollope, real life is down-to-earth and unexceptional." 
	 * The Reality Effect
 		* “There should be no episodes in a novel. Every sentence, every word, through all     those pages, should tend to the telling of the story.”
		* If there is no detail that does not advance the story, can the reality effect still take place? What would Trollope say to Barthes? 

## Characters
* In *An Autobiography*, Trollope demonstrates an almost parental attachment to his characters. What do we make of this? 
	*  “I had not the heart to kill her” (An Autobiography 111)
	* “I have wandered alone among the rocks and woods, crying at their grief, laughing at their absurdities, and thoroughly enjoying their joy. I have been impregnated with my own creations till it has been my only excitement to sit with the pen in my hand, and drive my team before me at as quick a pace as I could make them travel.”
	* “By no amount of description or asseveration could I succeed in making any reader understand how much these characters with their belongings have been to me in my latter life; or how frequently I have used them for the expression of my political and social convictions…they have served me as safety-valves by which to deliver my soul” (An Autobiography 180)

* What does Trollope refer to when he is talking about his "moral consciousness?"
	* “My archdeacon, who has been said to be life-like, and for whom I confess that I have all a parent's fond affection, was, I think, the simple result of an effort of my moral consciousness.”
	* If Tom Towers was at all like any gentleman then connected with the Times, my moral consciousness must again have been very powerful.

## The Problem of Non-Realist Characterization in Trollope

* **Yumi's introduction of seminar paper** 
	* "The question I take away from this is whether the realist novel might, in fact, be deeply dependent on character “types.” 
	* "in order to, say, instruct young women in “modest” behavior, characters had to be measurable against cultural norms of proper (gendered) behavior, and one way to do this was through inviting comparisons between them and stock character types, who came with predetermined judgments concerning the appropriateness of their behavior and gender performance. 
	* Can allegorical characters be realistic? 

* What makes Trollope’s characters sympathetic and real? Is he effective?

* How did Trollope complete the research necessary to build complex characters, considering that he wrote about the editor of the Times having never met him, and never lived in a church town? 

* How do you think Lukasc would feel about Trollope’s observations throughout his travels and the way he incorporates them into his novels?
      * “I never lived in any cathedral city,—except London, never knew anything of any Close, and at that time had enjoyed no peculiar intimacy with any clergyman” (An Autobiography 93)
      * “I will not describe the ceremony, as I do not precisely understand its nature. I am ignorant whether a bishop be chaired like a member of Parliament, or carried in a gilt coach like a lord mayor, or sworn in like a justice of peace, or introduced like a peer to the upper house, or led between two brethren like a knight of the garter: but I do know that everything was properly done, and that nothing fit or becoming to a young bishop was omitted on the occasion” (Barchester Towers 15)

   
* How do we reconcile the variability of characters with their coherence? Do characters have to “stand” for something? Why does Trollope draw attention to their flaws frequently? 
	* “There is – or would be, if Trollope ever went to extremes – a paradox in his conception of character, in the sense that precisely what is alleged to make character interesting – its variability – also risks undermining the coherence that allows character to flourish as a valid category in the first place.” 


## Moral Responsibility: Introduction

* What is the moral responsibility of the novel according to Trollope's Autobiography? Is it a novel’s job to teach citizens how to behave?
* Reviews of Trollope's novels: Are these social problem novels? 
* “I began to inquire what had been the nature of English novels since they first became common in our own language, and to be desirous of ascertaining whether they had done harm or good” (An Autobiography, 218-19)
* How is this analogous to the purpose and effects of television today?


## Gender, Marriage and Love 
* How does An Autobiography depict love and marriage? 
* “If I could do this, then I thought I might succeed in impregnating the mind of the novel-reader with a feeling that honesty is the best policy; that truth prevails while falsehood fails; that a girl will be loved as she is pure, and sweet, and unselfish; that a man will be honoured as he is true, and honest, and brave of heart; that things meanly done are ugly and odious, and things nobly done beautiful and gracious.” (An Autobiography, 145)
* “If I can teach politicians that they can do their business better by truth than by falsehood, I do a great service; but it is done to a limited number of persons. But if I can make young men and women believe that truth in love will make them happy, then, if my writings be popular, I shall have a very large class of pupils.” (An Autobiography, 225)

* **Adriana’s close reading**
	* "While it remains true that Eleanor’s actions are generally limited to her influence over romantic interests, her choices do carry significant weight."
	* Do you agree? 
* How does marriage stabilize and destabilize the social order? How do we think of characters like: 
	* “The virago, the siren, the “independent” woman (Mrs. Proudie, Signora Neroni, Eleanor) are roles in the patriarchal image-repertory as stock as the ladies’ man, the henpecked husband, the feckless father (Slope, Bishop Proudie, Harding)” (Miller 141) 

* How does the transgression of gender norms strengthen or weaken the social order? 

* Does a good, realistic novel always have a love plot?
	* "...there must be love in a novel." (An Autobiography, 142)
* Does love between characters serve an educative purpose? 

## Institutions: church, press, etc. 

* **Lanie’s summary of Miller** 
	* "Characters are at war with themselves no less than they are at war with one another" (Miller, 125)
	* "Trollope's institution has become...a wide, highly variegated network, with multiple and mutually correcting jurisfictions." (Miller, 128)
	* “Liberalism, free-thinking, and open inquiry will never object to appear in company with their opposites, because they have the conceit to think that they can quell those opposites; but the opposites will not appear in conjunction with liberalism, free-thinking, and open inquiry.” (An Autobiography, 191)
    * Where might we disagree with Miller? 
    * [A question from last week](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_2_outline.md#passages): how would you characterize these novels’ politics (for example, around modernity, class, reform, gender, nationality, the church?) Subversive? Conservative? Something else? Are there differences between the two books?

### Religion

*  **RJ’s close reading** + **RJ’s seminar paper**  
	* "Barchester Towers presents a religious system that not only relies on dualisms – the high and low church, the sacred and the profane – but also the politics of secular society."
* “In the formalism of power to which Trollope reduces his church, theology comes down to an ad hoc allusion or two,” as though only in the most perfunctory fashion to motivate the device that is thereby laid bare.” (Miller 116)
* What relationship does the church have to other institutions in Barchester Towers? What relationship do the clergymen have to laypeople?
	* “Reducing religion to an institution like any other, the novel achieves a compelling insight into the typical ideological process that process that is thus reversed: the self-promotion of an institution to the status of religion.” (Miller 117) 
* “...the sacred has only to put forth its claim and–like any other pretension in comedy–it is brought down to earth” (Miller 117)
	* “The point that clergymen are no better than other men is fondly and repeatedly made…” (An Autobiogrpahy 117)
* If religion is equal to other institutions, what role, if any, does it play in moderating characters’ behavior? What do you believe Trollope was trying to say about the church?

### Newspapers
* What role, if any, do the newspapers play in moderating characters’ behavior? What do you believe Trollope was trying to say about the press?
* Do you see any connections between the press and Foucault’s panopticon? Does the press give people a sense of constant surveillance? 

### Wrap-up of institutions
* What does moderate social behavior mean in Barchester Towers? What would Trollope argue? What would Miller argue? What would you argue?

## 4:00pm: Visit from PJ 

## Digital Humanities
* **Anna** can say a few words about her summary of Ramsay, and Yumi may have thoughts to contribute here as well, from her seminar paper!
* How can we compare Moretti's approach to Ramsay's?
