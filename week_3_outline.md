# Week 3

## What Makes a Good Novel?

> “In this chapter I will venture to name a few successful novelists of my own time, with whose works I am acquainted; and will endeavour to point whence their success has come, and why they have failed when there has been failure” (Trollope 243).

What emerges is that Trollope is chiefly concerned with two criteria:

* Is the novel realistic (or “human”)?
* Is the reader’s experience pleasurable?


## Style
* What does Trollope believe is important to the style of the novel? Does Trollope’s own style  conform to his expectations?
* How does authorial intrusion affect realism and his style?
            *  Irony and allusion: **Corey’s close reading**
	* The Reality Effect

 		*  “There should be no episodes in a novel. Every sentence, every word, through all     those pages, should tend to the telling of the story.”
		* If there is no detail that does not advance the story, can the reality effect still take place? What would Trollope say to Barthes?

## Characters
* What makes Trollope’s characters sympathetic and real? Is he effective?
* Is his characterization realistic? **Yumi can help us discuss this.**
* How did Trollope complete the research necessary to build complex characters, considering that he wrote about the editor of the Times having never met him, and never lived in a church town?
* How do you think Lukasc would feel about Trollope’s observations throughout his travels and the way he incorporates them into his novels?
* “I never lived in any cathedral city,—except London, never knew anything of any Close, and at that time had enjoyed no peculiar intimacy with any clergyman” (An Autobiography 93)
* “I will not describe the ceremony, as I do not precisely understand its nature. I am ignorant whether a bishop be chaired like a member of Parliament, or carried in a gilt coach like a lord mayor, or sworn in like a justice of peace, or introduced like a peer to the upper house, or led between two brethren like a knight of the garter: but I do know that everything was properly done, and that nothing fit or becoming to a young bishop was omitted on the occasion” (Barchester Towers 15)

* What do we make of Trollope’s almost parental attachment to his characters?
* “I had not the heart to kill her” (An Autobiography 111)
	* “I have wandered alone among the rocks and woods, crying at their grief, laughing at their absurdities, and thoroughly enjoying their joy. I have been impregnated with my own creations till it has been my only excitement to sit with the pen in my hand, and drive my team before me at as quick a pace as I could make them travel.”
	* “By no amount of description or asseveration could I succeed in making any reader understand how much these characters with their belongings have been to me in my latter life; or how frequently I have used them for the expression of my political and social convictions…they have served me as safety-valves by which to deliver my soul” (An Autobiography 180)
* What is he talking about when he refers to his “moral consciousness?”
	* “My archdeacon, who has been said to be life-like, and for whom I confess that I have all a parent's fond affection, was, I think, the simple result of an effort of my moral consciousness.”
	* If Tom Towers was at all like any gentleman then connected with the Times, my moral consciousness must again have been very powerful.
* How do we reconcile the variability of characters with their coherence? Do characters have to “stand” for something? Why does Trollope draw attention to their flaws frequently?
	* “There is – or would be, if Trollope ever went to extremes – a paradox in his conception of character, in the sense that precisely what is alleged to make character interesting – its variability – also risks undermining the coherence that allows character to flourish as a valid category in the first place.”



## Moral Responsibility: Introduction

* What is the moral responsibility of the novel? Is it a novel’s job to teach citizens how to behave?

	* “I began to inquire what had been the nature of English novels since they first became common     in our own language, and to be desirous of ascertaining whether they had done harm or good” (218-19)
* How is this analogous to the purpose and effects of television today?


## Gender, Marriage and Love
* Does a good, realistic novel always have a love plot?
* Does love between characters serve an educative purpose?
* “If I could do this, then I thought I might succeed in impregnating the mind of the novel-reader with a feeling that honesty is the best policy; that truth prevails while falsehood fails; that a girl will be loved as she is pure, and sweet, and unselfish; that a man will be honoured as he is true, and honest, and brave of heart; that things meanly done are ugly and odious, and things nobly done beautiful and gracious.”
* “If I can teach politicians that they can do their business better by truth than by falsehood, I do a great service; but it is done to a limited number of persons. But if I can make young men and women believe that truth in love will make them happy, then, if my writings be popular, I shall have a very large class of pupils.”
* **Adriana’s close reading**
* How does marriage stabilize and destabilize the social order? How do we think of characters like:
	* “The virago, the siren, the “independent” woman (Mrs. Proudie, Signora Neroni, Eleanor) are roles in the patriarchal image-repertory as stock as the ladies’ man, the henpecked husband, the feckless father (Slope, Bishop Proudie, Harding)” (Miller 141)
* How does the transgression of gender norms strengthen or weaken the social order?

## Institutions: church, press, etc.

* **Lanie’s summary of Miller**

### Religion

* ** RJ’s close reading + RJ’s seminar paper**
	*“In the formalism of power to which Trollope reduces his church, theology comes down to an ad hoc allusion or two,” as though only in the most perfunctory fashion to motivate the device that is thereby laid bare.” (Miller 116)
* What relationship does the church have to other institutions in Barchester Towers? What relationship do the clergymen have to laypeople?
	* “Reducing religion to an institution like any other, the novel achieves a compelling insight into the typical ideological process that process that is thus reversed: the self-promotion of an institution to the status of religion.” (Miller 117)
* “...the sacred has only to put forth its claim and–like any other pretension in comedy–it is brought down to earth” (Miller 117)
	* “The point that clergymen are no better than other men is fondly and repeatedly made…” (An Autobiogrpahy 117)
* If religion is equal to other institutions, what role, if any, does it play in moderating characters’ behavior? What do you believe Trollope was trying to say about the church?
### Newspapers
* What role, if any, do the newspapers play in moderating characters’ behavior? What do you believe Trollope was trying to say about the press?
* Do you see any connections between the press and Foucault’s panopticon? Does the press give people a sense of constant surveillance?
### Wrap-up of institutions
* What does moderate social behavior in Barchester Towers? What would Trollope argue? What would Miller argue? What would you argue?
