## Week 14 Outline *Middlemarch* 2nd Half

### Corey, Adriana, Luke, Gaby

### 1:15 PJ shows off the latest iteration of the Barsetshire visualization 

#### Finale

> Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young lives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know what befell them in their after-years? For the fragment of a life, however typical, is not the sample of an even web… (Opening of Finale)

+ What does the finale and its return to Middlemarch say about how minor characters are treated with respect to the little time they are given by the narrator?

+ The “finale” departs from Eliot’s usual narrative style. Does this finale create a problem for realist fiction in the same way we’ve discussed about the other novel conclusions we’ve seen? 

+ Why does Eliot use “prelude” and “finale” in her novel rather than “preface” and “epilogue?” 

+ How might Poovey’s account of the Barchester series square with the totalized single novel of *Middlemarch*? [Poovey from Week 2](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_2_outline.md#poovey-2011-we-have-lots-of-questions-here-because-there-are-lots-of-interesting-applications-to-trollope-and-which-tie-together-all-of-our-discussion-of-realism)

+ [thinking back to the beginning and ending of *The Mill on the Floss*](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_12_outline.md#close-read-the-opening) 

+ how might we think about the different uses of the web metaphor that culminate in the ending? How have [previous seminars thought about it?](https://github.com/vic-sem-2015/outlines/blob/master/week_14_outline.md#webs----more-untangling)

#### Realism

+ Classifying

 + Finale last lines: 

 > Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual life, any more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in daring all for the sake of a brother's burial: the medium in which their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant people with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that of the Dorothea whose story we know.
 	Her finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were not widely visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs. (838)

+ Semiotics / [Barthes discussion from week 2](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_2_outline.md#barthes-1968----anna-summarized) (Barthes from week TWO LINKS - reality effect and preparation)
[Barthes - Preparation part I](https://github.com/adriobi/firstrepo/blob/master/Barthes%2C%20Preparation%2C%20part%201.pdf) and [II](https://github.com/adriobi/firstrepo/blob/master/Barthes%2C%20Preparation%2C%20part%202.pdf) 

+ [Week 13 on Lydgate](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_13_outline.md#literacy-language-representation--relationship-to-knowledge)

 > “Or surely all must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed, counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as a future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a **cluster of signs** for his neighbors' false suppositions.” (142)

 > "How can one describe a man? I can give you an inventory: heavy eyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid white hands—and—let me see—oh, an exquisite cambric pocket-handkerchief. But you will see him. You know this is about the time of his visits." (114)

+ New developments on Lydgate’s unknowability:

 > But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars enough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to intensify differences into partisanship; some  of the particulars being of that impressive order of which **the significance is entirely hidden, like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a note of exclamation at the end**. (emphasis ours) 

 > The Lydgate with whom she had been in love had been a group of airy conditions for her, most of which had disappeared, while their place had been taken by everyday details which must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated through with a rapid selection of favourable aspects. (661)

+ Sympathy

 + Retelling story again:
 > "If you knew how it came about, it would not seem wonderful to you."
 
 > "Can't you tell me?" said Celia, settling her arms cozily.
 
 > "No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know." (822)

 + How novel imagines lifespans, experience of reading
 
  + serialization 
  
  + Though published in 1870, *Middlemarch* is set in 1830 - Eliot’s (and presumably some readers’) childhood. Why the historical distance? What the effect of narrative present and readerly present?

+ Think about the novel and sympathy - through the semester?  

 + Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, "You will certainly go mad in that house alone, my dear.  You will see visions. We have all got to exert ourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as other people call them by.  To be sure, for younger sons and women who have no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care of then.  But you must not run into that.  I dare say you are a little bored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might become yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing tragedy queen and taking things sublimely.  Sitting alone in that library at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must get a few people round you who wouldn't believe you if you told them. That is a good lowering medicine." (537) 

+ Jaffee and Childers 

 + Jaffee and Childers are less theories of the novel than surveys of broad fields of existing theories.
 
  + Jaffee surveys post-Victorian theories of the novel. Into which of Jaffee’s categories do some of the theorists we read fit into? Remember that that consist of:  modernist critique, “new” criticism, feminist criticism, reader-response criticism, Marxist criticism, deconstruction and realistic critique, Foucauldian criticism, new historicism, psychoanalytic criticism, gender and queer theory, cultural criticism, postcolonial criticism, and the new nineteenth century. (For brief reminders of what these are, check out Gaby’s critsum.) Some theorists we’ve read: D.A. Miller, Dorritt Cohn, M. M. Bakhtin, Mary Poovey, Ann M. Blair, Buurma/Heffernan, Anna Peak, Patrick Leary, etc.
 
 + Childers surveys Victorian theories of the novel, often written by the novelists themselves.
 
  + George Eliot’s theory of the novel: “the greatest benefit we owe to the artist… is the extension of our sympathies… a picture of human life of such great as a great artist can give, surprises even sympathies… a picture of human life such as a great artist can give, surprises even the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart from themselves, which may be called the raw material of moral sentiment.” (Eliot)
 
  + Childers’ elaboration: “For Eliot the value of art lies precisely in its ability to connect the subjectivities of disparate beings. Her goals as a novelist was to help her readers to be better able to imagine and feel *”the pains and joys of those who are different from themselves in everything but the broad fact of being struggling erring human creatures.”* For her, in both form and content, a novel should offer a moral standard for human interaction without stooping to didacticism. She believed that a novel’s situations should arise from *“some natural combination of character with circumstances”* and not because *“men and women speak and act in order to prove a moral or to rouse some sentiment in the reader.”* 

+ Why might Woolf, known modernist, praise Eliot so highly? 

#### Middlemarch’s production

![British Museum Reading Room](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/British_Museum_Reading_Room_Panorama_Feb_2006.jpg/1920px-British_Museum_Reading_Room_Panorama_Feb_2006.jpg)

+ Susan Bernstein on Eliot’s spaces for reading, research, & writing (Gaby’s critsum)

 + The Reading Room, the London Library, and Eliot’s salon
 
 
  + The Reading Room was an enormous, semi-public space in the British Museum, the London Library a more exclusive network of libraries with private reading spaces, 
 
  + What do you think of studies of the architectural/social spaces that authors inhabited for insights regarding their personality and work? What are its uses? What are its limitations?


#### Politics

+ What is going ooooon????

 + 1832 Reform Bill 

 + Relationship to events in Middlemarch; scale, realism

+ Mr. Brooke’s speech (502-503)

+ Denotative [like Freedgood and Nithya’s summary from Week 12?](https://github.com/adriobi/firstrepo/blob/master/Freedgood_Schmitt_synopsis_Nithya.pdf)

#### Realism

> Railroad, and maybe Marxism (gasp)?! “In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public opinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy corner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding rather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor of Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick, there being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to fatten Hiram Ford's pig, or of a publican at the "Weights and Scales" who would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the three neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without distinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing with the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every knowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given to fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to believe that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard heaven itself as rather disposed to take them in—a disposition observable in the weather.” (554)

> A projected line was to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed in a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the infant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of Caleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to two persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its difficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various landed proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but sentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways were as exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of Cholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were women and landholders. (553)

> He had never mentioned to Rosamond his brooding purpose of going to Quallingham … . A slice of the railway would enable him to manage the whole journey and back in four days. (663)

+ **Nithya’s close reading**

#### Narrative Styles

+ “Psychological realism”

+ Differences from other narrators we’ve seen. Perhaps compare to Trollope; how do these two authors’ narrators compare to one another?

+ Eliot jumps between character perspectives. What is the purpose of doing so? Is she trying to convince the reader of something/ align the reader with the narrator?

 > Enough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land from Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for some time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it thus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded phraseology. (520)

 + compare to: 
 
 > One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect. (278)

#### Middlemarch (the place) 

+ Personification of Middlemarch [(back to Week 13)](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_13_outline.md#realism)

 > Good Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their doctor without reason shown… 

 > Widgeon’s Purifying Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine
 

### Scale 

+ *Middlemarch’s* length & scope

 > I at least have so much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe.” (141) 

 > “whatever has been or is to be narrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by being considered a parable; so that if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought into view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more than figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company with persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about loobies, my reader's imagination need not be entirely excluded from an occupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of high standing would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the level of high commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of proportional ciphers.” (341)

+ Middlemarch’s relationship to the surrounding countryside and to urban settings

 + foreigners / xenophobia
 
  + Will, Lydgate, and Bulstrode
  
 + How much of the action actually takes place in Middlemarch? Outside of it?

+ The Middlemarch gossip mill

 > But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the smell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it were required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles. Caleb was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the last week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that Raffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up Bulstrode's affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp of an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from Garth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to be the chief publisher of Bulstrode's misdemeanors. (718) historiography

 > "And a good wife poor Harriet has been," said Mrs. Plymdale.  "She thinks her husband the first of men.  It's true he has never denied her anything."
"Well, we shall see what she will do," said Mrs. Hackbutt.  "I suppose she knows nothing yet, poor creature.  I do hope and trust I shall not see her, for I should be frightened to death lest I should say anything about her husband.  Do you think any hint has reached her?"
"I should hardly think so," said Mrs. Tom Toller.  "We hear that he is ill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on Thursday; but she was with her girls at church yesterday, and they had new Tuscan bonnets.  Her own had a feather in it.  I have never seen that her religion made any difference in her dress." "She wears very neat patterns always," said Mrs. Plymdale, a little stung.  "And that feather I know she got dyed a pale lavender on purpose to be consistent.  I must say it of Harriet that she wishes to do right." (742) community commentary

 > News is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen which the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery they are) when they are buzzing in search of their particular nectar. (599)


#### Gender, Desire, and Love

+ George Eliot’s research practices - Romola 

+ **Lanie’s close reading**

+ Family relationships

 + Baby 
  > We should not grieve, should we, baby?" said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise of the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to the nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to make—you didn't know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form. (491)

 + Marriage and love as a sort of labour

  > She longed for work which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb, where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would never see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and fellowship—turning his face towards her as he went. (475)

  > At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband's places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed especially to her, except that "Synoptical Tabulation," which was probably only the beginning of many intended directions for her guidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan of transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea's competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust of any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for himself out of Dorothea's nature: she could do what she resolved to do: and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to erect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the future volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But the months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had time to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp on Dorothea's life. (493)

  > Dorothea would have been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had been need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an aunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has nothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear monotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible. (535)

  > That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if she has no variety to choose from? A woman's choice usually means taking the only man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her friends don't exert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon business yet. (538)

+ Eroticism in *Middlemarch*. 

 + Does this detract from the realist novel? How might we compare instances of eroticism in other novels we’ve read this semester?

 + [Kurnick](https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_13_outline.md#kurnick) — desire/Rome

  > It had seemed to him as if they were like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence, while their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. (543)

  > Their young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one else would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of the past. (547)

 + Rosamond and Lydgate’s inability to communicate
 
 + Rosamond’s “playing parts”

  > ‘If I loved, I should love at once and without change,’ said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and playing the part prettily. (297)


#### Potluck

+ Mr. Brooke’s speech 

+ Bulstrode guilt: 

 > Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily candid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is inaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent himself just as he is, even in his own reflections? Bulstrode had not yet unravelled in his thought the confused promptings of the last four-and-twenty hours. (710)

+ Close read ch. 51 epigraph
 + relationship to chapter? 


#### Throwback to last week

+ Returning to Kurnick, now that we’ve read the ending…is Dorothea really a failed heroine? Why did she fail?

+ We saw (or I did, anyway) Eliot’s preoccupation with science last week, whether that be classification, natural history, or arguing from maxims. Did that mission hold true at the level of plot and general organization? Was this a novel of hypotheticals?

+ Is Eliot’s project of objectivity (lived experience, looking past oneself) successful?

+ How does the past haunt the book’s end? Does its length help contribute a local historical effect?

+ Middlemarch the place and the metonym. How our characters interact with it (hint: they leave). Middlemarch a gossip wheel.

+ Prologue and finale bookending novel - what the effect?

+ Humbleness?

+ History - why the distance?

+ Dynamism of characters?

+ What might a character map look like? What does this say?

+ was anything actually insignificant? what invisible pressures did the outside world exert? is romance entirely absent here?

+ compared to Ian Watt’s rise of the novel, character’s don’t really testify for themselves here, do they?

+ Farebrother? Fred?


#### **Grand** Wrap-up

+ we <3 seminar let’s think about all the wonderful things we’ve learned :) 

+ Reading for the plot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
