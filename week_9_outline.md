# Week 9: Bouvard and Pécuchet

![Cover of Nichols edition of translated B and P]()

### Realism

+ Close-reading: the very beginning of the novel 
+ What do we make of the almost rehearsed nature of this beginning?
+ What makes this a novel? What was your experience of reading this? Did you feel like you identified with the characters or invested emotionally in what went on? 

> “On the level of beliefs about the world, Bouvard et Pecuchet captures a liberal public sphere that ends by being tolerant of various beliefs from impotence rather than broad-mindedness. Differences stand, ultimately, because Bouvard and Pecuchet never become characters in the way the realist novel has taught us to expect characters to be.” (791) — Frances Ferguson

+ **Luke’s summary of Ferguson**
+ What is the nature of realism in Bouvard and Pécuchet? Do you agree with Ferguson that this is not a typically realist novel? Or rather, how does this book revise some of the canonical theories of realism we have read about? What’s the nature of characterization and plot in the novel? 

> “In presenting both the assemblage of the archive and its reception, Pierrot, Mouchard, and Neefs note that Flaubert establishes a kind of "equality between author and reader" and renders "the reality of the author almost as problematic as that of the reader." For in the projected ending—in which Bouvard and Pécuchet simply sit at a common desk copying out a host of different kinds of materials Flaubert aims at a literature that is so purely descriptive as to amount only to the mere publication of what already exists.This would be a literature that never corrects its protagonists, never brings them news from afar to qualify the things that those characters think they know here. It would be a literature as pure as the folk tales of the oral tradition are pure — not in being authentic but in being available to a host of different speakers in positions of absolute equality and equivalence with one another.”
		
+ Pull back [Cohn on narrated monologue, Bakhtin on heteroglossia] (https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_4_outline.md), if anyone feels so inclined.
+ Does Flaubert’s lack of narrated monologue and interiority create equality in his narrative, unlike in Hard Cash, where only some characters are afforded the luxury of voice? 
+ What do we make of the characters’ lack of interiority? 


+ **RJ’s papers** on allusion. How do allusions and reference function in Bouvard et Pécuchet? Compared to how they function in Reade? 
+ 1896 cover, reception + sexuality? 

### Notation, Research, Information
+ Close-read last two chapters. 

+ **Adriana’s seminar paper:** “the mode in which they engage with new information is to, in a sense, copy it onto themselves and onto the world around them, to effectively attempt to transcribe it upon empirical reality.
	“In some cases, the effect of their literal approach is, somewhat absurdly, to obscure the meaning that copying attempts to convey.”

+ **Gaby’s seminar paper:** “This all relates to Michel Foucault’s assertion from The Order of Things that each discipline has its own language, and in fact, that the sciences’ ability to ascertain truth is ultimately limited to the properties of language.”

+ Is Flaubert trying to point out that copying or Bouvard and Pécuchet’s particular way of processing (or not processing) knowledge is the problem, or is there a larger problem for human beings (of communicating or developing information)? 

+ *On Flaubert’s Notes*:  
+ How do we read the parts that Flaubert has tried to make deliberately inscrutable for readers, or where he is deliberately misleading us?
	+ “Many times it is necessary that the reader may believe that they will change their life and environment.”
	+ “There is a mystery below where the reader should understand nothing.”
 	+ To what extent do his notes provide evidence that there is an ideology underlying description, even if it isn’t explicit to the reader? How do an author’s notes disrupt Lukacs’ idea of description as “pure”?

### Break 

### Barthes, [“The Preparation of the Novel”](http://www.ubu.com/sound/barthes.html) 

+ **Corey’s summary of Preparation of the Novel**
+ **Rachel’s summary of continuities and discontinuities between “The Reality Effect” and Preparation**

+ **Yumi’s close-reading:**

> “Both Bouvard and Pecuchet occupy a number of roles over the course of the novel, but these change frequently, and they often seem to lack other defining characteristics. We are given only minimal detail about their histories, physical appearances, and so forth, and their interiorities typically seem interchangeable; they share the same interests and many of the same desires and beliefs. This sense that they are generic rather than specific people seems to suggest that they stand in for the idea of clerks or suddenly wealthy petit-bourgeois men rather than imitating specific individuals of the sort one might encounter in life. This almost seems to align Flaubert’s work in writing about Bouvard and Pecuchet with the work of the authors whose books they read: they are conceptual abstractions or generic types, perhaps based on empirical observation but necessarily lacking the specificity of any actual empirical examples of the concepts they instantiate. But then what does this say about the value of Flaubert’s project? Bouvard and Pecuchet’s knowledge seems largely useless, somehow both too abstract and too detailed, unable to make contact with the empirical world it purports to describe. So what work does this view of information and representation leave for the realist (?) novelist to perform? What balance between description and abstraction should a novelist strike—or is it necessary to think in terms other than these?” 

+ What do we make of Flaubert’s balance between detailed description of minute details and creation of characters that seem “generic rather than specific”?
+ Does this balance complicate Lukacs’ binary between simple description and ideological narration? 

> “In the course of writing his greatest book, L’Education sentimentale, Flaubert expressed a fear that ‘the milieu in which my characters disport themselves is so teeming and copious that on every page they risk being swallowed by it.’” 
[Information overload] (https://github.com/vic-sem-2016/outlines/blob/master/week_8_outline.md) — support for Blair’s point that this is not a modern phenomenon, so how does the novel seem to be thinking about attention economies and directing people through everything in this era of Victorian mass literacy + printing?    


Return to your experience of reading the book — did you feel overloaded by reading this?  


> “What makes Bouvard et Pécuchet at once more approachable...is that on this occasion, instead of simply drawing on his sources silently in the normal way, Flaubert gives some of them at least an actual presence in the text, where Messrs B. and P. are made to turn, for the botanical, chemical, archaeological and other assorted knowledges that they believe will profit them, to the same literature in whose company their author had spent so many months.” 

> “It looks as though he has deliberately misused his own time in order to show his, as it turns out, insufficiently lucid simpletons misusing theirs: as though the successive pratfalls that they are asked to take in the course of the book are so many opportunities for Flaubert to draw attention to his unusual capacity for suffering in the service of a transcendent Art.” — Sturrock 

+ What is the point? Our vision of the artist — do you need to suffer (via taking copious notes and doing a ton of research) to write a realist novel?
+ Yumi’s point about authorial intention last week — we don’t need to limit ourselves to authorial intent, of course, but the idea that we shouldn’t think about the author’s intention at all is perhaps produced by the notion that Poovey talks about (that the novel is and should be treated just as aesthetic)

### Dictionary of Accepted Ideas

> “He had envisaged this as forming part of a longer work of fiction, and the publisher of this new – and, in my sampling of it, first-rate – translation of Bouvard et Pécuchet has rightly included it, to serve as a postscript to the novel.”

+ What are the implications of thinking of the DoAI as part of Bouvard et Pécuchet or not? Do we agree that it should be considered a part of this novel, and what does that mean for each of the texts and their relation to each other? 

+ What can we say about this that is more interesting than, “Flaubert wanted to talk about how stupid the bourgeoisie are, and how they talk about things they know nothing about?” This is part of an unfinished project and it was supposed to be a lot longer — what’s the point, or what are the effects? 


+ Is this Flaubert’s or written by B+P? 

+ Does tacking this dictionary on at the end change the way that we think of the novel as made?
