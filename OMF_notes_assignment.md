## Novels and Notes: the Preparation of *Our Mutual Friend*

ENGL111: Victorian Novel Research Seminar
Due: Tuesday, March 2, 2016 by midnight

This assignment asks you to think about the relationship between Dickens's notes towards *Our Mutual Friend* and the finished, published novel we have been reading over the last few weeks. The assignent ask you to index, close read, and then theorize.

Drawing on our readings about novelists' notebooks

1. Choose one of the double-page sheets of notes that corresponds to one of the monthly number of *Our Mutual Friend*. Make sure that no one else is working on that number, and the post a quick internal note to Known to claim yours.

2. Read over the page of notes. *Then create an index keying each note to the corresponding pages of OMF. Include both your page numbers and the relevant volume and chapter number. Add quick notes if you like on anything you find interesting.*

3. Select one especially interesting note-novel combination and close read; use the example we discussed in class. (If you are especially interested in a note that doesn't to correlate directly to a passage of scene in the novel you can do that too, but you will have to do some extra thinking and framing.)

In your response, you should include an image excerpting the note of interest, as well as a transcription of
Please also somewhere include a link to the image of the page of notes on the [Dickens Working Notes
Project](http://dickensnotes.com/).

*Write a paragraph or two of this reading.*

4. Further thinking and theorizing:

Drawing on Simon Reader's work, can you read your page of notes, or the notes as a whole, or some fragment of them, on their own terms? Can you think about their formal and aesthetic qualities? (Did you do this in part 3?) What is at stake in doing this?

Related: also began to ask in class what in would mean to consider these note not as an origin, but as an algorithmic transformation, by-product, or paratext in Stephen Ramsay's sense.

*Write perhaps another paragraph engaging one of these questions or some related question.*

5. Add the results of 2, 3, and 5 as a post to our Known. Format in Markdown, at least minimally.
