# Dickens’ serialization and note-taking

## *Dickens as a Serial Novelist* - Kate Tillotson and John Butt

“...each monthly ‘part’ or number consisted of three or four chapters, covering thirty-two pages of print, with two plates, and several pages of advertisements… [*Our Mutual Friend*] was planned for completion in nineteen monthly numbers, the last being a double number priced at two shillings, and containing, besides forty-eight pages of text and four plates, the title-page, frontispiece, preface, and other preliminaries.” (Tillotson & Butt, 14)

“The design and purpose of the novel had to be kept constantly in view; but the writer had also to think in terms of the identity of the serial number, which would have to make its own impact and be judged as a unit. Incident and interest had therefore to be evenly spread, since ‘the writer… cannot afford to have many pages skipped out of the few which are to meet the reader’s eye at the same time.” Chapters must be balanced within a number in respect both of length and of effect. Each number must lead, if not to a climax, at least to a point of rest; and the rest between numbers is necessarily more extended than what the mere chapters divisions provide. The writer had also bear in mind that his readers were constantly interrupted for prolonged periods, and that he must take this into account in his characterization and, to some extent, in plotting. So as early as the original preface to *Pickwick,* Dickens showed his recognition that not every story is suited to this type of publication.” (Tillotson & Butt, 15)

### Questions

+ How could the strict page counts for “parts” of *Our Mutual Friend* have influenced its narrative structure? Looking at the divisions, how are characters and plotlines introduced and advanced across parts? Do individual parts seem to have coherent narrative or thematic structures?

+ How might serialization have influenced Victorian readers’ experience of *Our Mutual Friend*? What changes when we read it in a modern edition?

+ What references do we see to material texts within *Our Mutual Friend*? Can we relate those back to the material form of Dickens’ publications? (see pp. 44, 52)

+ What insights do Dickens’ notes provide about his work? Examine Chapters V-VII as presented in these notes.

+ What questions can Dickens’ notes answer? What questions or interpretive issues do they raise? We might consider Stone’s argument about Dickens’ names (see 21-23). What information does Stone get from Dickens’ notes that he couldn’t have gotten from reading his published work? Thinking about Ramsay: do Dickens’ notes “prove” or falsify a claim, allow new questions to be asked, or some combination? To what extent is this an argument about authorial intent?

+ Can we connect issues of note-taking to the DH work we’ve been doing?


# Figural languages

## *Narrated Monologue from Transparent Minds* - (‘Lil) Dorrit Cohn

*Quoted monologue*
+ (He thought:) I am late
+ (He thought:) I was late
+ (He thought): I will be late

*Narrated monologue*
+ He was late
+ He had been late
+ He would be late

*Psycho-narration*
+ He knew he was late
+ He knew he had been late
+ He knew he would be late


+ What’s the difference between these three techniques?

“A transformation of figural thought-language into the narrative language of third-person fiction is precisely what characterizes the technique for rendering consciousness that will occupy us throughout this chapter, and that I call the narrated monologue. It may be most succinctly defined as the technique for rendering a character’s thought in his own idiom while maintaining the third-person reference and the basic tense of narration.” (Cohn, 100)

“My own term “narrated monologue” as an English equivalent for *style indirect libre* [free indirect discourse] and *erlebte Rede* calls for some justification and clarification. The French and German terms generally designated not only the rendering of spoken discourse, which displays identical linguistic features. I have deliberately chosen a term that excludes this analogous employment of the technique, because in a literary - rather than a strictly linguistic - perspective the narration of silent thoughts presents problems that are quite separate, and far more intricate and interesting than those presented by its more vocal twin **”Narrated discourse” involves neither the ambiguity concerning the actual-potential status of language that characterizes the narrated monologue, nor the difficulties of recognizing it within its narrative context.**” (Cohn, 109)

+ What would be a good working definition for *narrated monologue* based on these two excerpts? How does it differ from **free indirect discourse**?

+ What does Cohn mean by “figural” in “figural minds” and “figural narration”?

+ Let’s briefly describe and define free indirect discourse, and let’s figure out what the relation between FID and narrated monologue is.

### Article summary (Cohn’s claims)

+ Jane Austen was one of the first writers to use *narrated monologue* extensively 

+ Used in “...more slowly paced novels dominated by their characters’ fluid mental responses to momentary experience…” (Cohn, 115)

+ Originates from creating *ironic distance from* or *sympathy for* a character’s viewpoint

+ Recognizable in otherwise inexplicable shifts in tense

+ *Narrated monologue* situated between psycho-narration and quoted monologue in its proximity to the character’s figural unconscious 


(Cohn, 139)

*Narrated monologue* thus represents an advancement in the depiction of different strata of the figural mind. 

+  Cohn argues, as we’ve noted, that narrated monologue commits us to either irony or sympathy; do we agree? Other critics (some of whom we will meet later in the semester) want to claim a specific interpretation for all forms of narrated monologue (or of free indirect discourse, of which narrated monologue is one type); what might we imagine an interpretation of narrated monologue or FID *tout court* might be? 

### Questions

+ **Nithya’s close reading** of “Podsnappery” (see pp. 131-2) draws on Cohn. Let’s look at this passage together.

+ Let’s also look at **Luke’s close reading** of the introduction to Mr. Twemlow. What would Cohn make of this scene, in particular the passage Luke discusses where Dickens describes characters’ reflections in the mirror (p. 10)?

+ How does this theorization of narration compare to Miller’s idea of third-person narration as a form of panopticism? Possible points of comparison: how do both theorists treat the relationships among author, narrator, and characters? How do Cohn’s ideas about distance and sympathy compare to Miller? Do their methodologies or areas of emphasis differ at all?

+ Looking ahead to Corey’s seminar paper, what would Cohn say about passages like the one where the narrator imagines one of the Podsnaps’ plates talking (p. 131)?

# “Discourse in the Novel” - Mikhail Bakhtin

“The novel can be defined as a diversity of social speech types (sometimes even diversity of languages) and a diversity of individual voices, artistically organized. the internal stratification of any single national language into social dialects, characteristic group behavior, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and passing fashions, languages that serve the specific sociopolitical purposes of the day, even of the hour (each day has its own slogan, its own vocabulary, its own emphases!) - this internal stratification present in every language at any given moment of its historical existence is the indispensable prerequisite for the novel as a genre. The novel orchestrates all its themes, the totality of the world of objects and ideas depicted and expressed in it, by means of the social diversity of speech types [*raznorecie*] and by the differing individual voices that flourish under such conditions. *Authorial speech, the speeches of narrators, inserted genres, the speech of characters are merely these fundamental compositional unities with whose help **heteroglossia** [*raznorecie*] can enter the novel…*” (Cohn, 262-3)

### Article summary (Bakhtin’s claims)

+ Traditional stylistics (descended from discourse surrounding poetry, the epic, etc.) are inadequate for explaining the novel’s artistic value because they’re premised on the assumption of a *single unified authorial language.* The core of the novel’s art, in contrast, comes from its ability to present *many social languages in discourse with one another,* or **heteroglossia.**

+ The novel can be better appreciated by examining it within the tradition of *rhetoric* alongside poetics

+ Every utterance anticipates a response and has no “neutral” meaning outside of its recipients’ interpretations.

### Questions

+ **RJ’s critical summary**: What are Bakhtin’s major points?

+ What is language according to Bakhtin?

+ Can we define heteroglossia? Dialogism? Dialogized heteroglossia?

+ What is the role of the author in this theory? In what ways does the author control the language they use, and vice versa?

+ What is the significance of unity in Bakhtin’s theory?

“So great is the role played by these genres that are incorporated into novels that it might seem as if the novel is denied any primary means for verbally appropriating reality, that it has no approach of its own, and therefore requires the help of other genres to re-process reality; the novel itself has the appearance of being merely a secondary syncretic unification of other seemingly primary verbal genres.” (321)

+ Does this support or challenge any other theories of realism that we’ve read?

+ What does Bakhtin value in Dickens?

+ What different “languages” do we see in Dickens?

+ What are the effects of dialogized heteroglossia in *Our Mutual Friend?* Does it serve an ideological purpose, and if so, how is that conveyed?


# Seminar papers: Dickens’ class politics

+ **Lanie** and **Corey** can summarize their seminar papers.

+ From Lanie’s paper: “if Dickens is admonishing wealthy, ironically, for both its complexity and its boredom, why is it the contented poor man who dies?”

+ Broadly, how do you read Dickens’ class politics in this novel? What is he satirizing? What is he supporting?

+ How do class signifiers function in the text? What relation does this have to other forms of realist (or non-realist) characterization we’ve discussed?

+ Who do we imagine as the intended audience for this text? (If possible, using what we know about the materiality and distribution of the text as evidence.)

+  Is there a question harking back to (and distinguishing itself from) Jameson’s “Realist Floor-plan” here?

+ Drawing on Corey’s paper: what can we make of the way that “humans are reduced to objects and objects are elevated to living presences” in Dickens?

+ How would you compare Dickens’ treatment of class, the class structure, and/or capitalism to Trollope’s? To Trollope’s parody version of Dickens? See passage from Trollope below; we might compare with Dickens’ description of the Veneerings’ household (p. 6) or of Gaffer and his house (p. 21).

From “The Warden”:

In former times great objects were attained by great work. When evils were to be reformed, reformers set about their heavy task with grave decorum and laborious argument. An age was occupied in proving a grievance, and philosophical researches were printed in folio pages, which it took a life to write, and an eternity to read. We get on now with a lighter step, and quicker: ridicule is found to be more convincing than argument, imaginary agonies touch more than true sorrows, and monthly novels convince, when learned quartos fail to do so. If the world is to be set right, the work will be done by shilling numbers.

Of all such reformers Mr Sentiment is the most powerful. It is incredible the number of evil practices he has put down: it is to be feared he will soon lack subjects, and that when he has made the working classes comfortable, and got bitter beer put into proper-sized pint bottles, there will be nothing further for him left to do. Mr Sentiment is certainly a very powerful man, and perhaps not the less so that his good poor people are so very good; his hard rich people so very hard; and the genuinely honest so very honest. [...] Perhaps, however, Mr Sentiment's great attraction is in his second-rate characters. If his heroes and heroines walk upon stilts, as heroes and heroines, I fear, ever must, their attendant satellites are as natural as though one met them in the street: they walk and talk like men and women, and live among our friends a rattling, lively life; yes, live, and will live till the names of their calling shall be forgotten in their own, and Buckett and Mrs Gamp will be the only words left to us to signify a detective police officer or a monthly nurse.

"The Almshouse" opened with a scene in a clergyman's house. Every luxury to be purchased by wealth was described as being there: all the appearances of household indulgence generally found amongst the most self-indulgent of the rich were crowded into this abode. Here the reader was introduced to the demon of the book, the Mephistopheles of the drama. [...]  He was a man well stricken in years, but still strong to do evil: he was one who looked cruelly out of a hot, passionate, bloodshot eye; who had a huge red nose with a carbuncle, thick lips, and a great double, flabby chin, which swelled out into solid substance, like a turkey-cock's comb, when sudden anger inspired him: he had a hot, furrowed, low brow, from which a few grizzled hairs were not yet rubbed off by the friction of his handkerchief: he wore a loose unstarched white handkerchief, black loose ill-made clothes, and huge loose shoes, adapted to many corns and various bunions: his husky voice told tales of much daily port wine, and his language was not so decorous as became a clergyman. [...]

The second chapter of course introduced the reader to the more especial inmates of the hospital. [...] It was shocking to find how the conversation of these eight starved old men in their dormitory shamed that of the clergyman's family in his rich drawing-room. The absolute words they uttered were not perhaps spoken in the purest English, and it might be difficult to distinguish from their dialect to what part of the country they belonged; the beauty of the sentiment, however, amply atoned for the imperfection of the language; and it was really a pity that these eight old men could not be sent through the country as moral missionaries, instead of being immured and starved in that wretched almshouse.
